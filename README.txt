To build:

We have one aditional library for sound. I have included the libraries folder in the root directory you can use this if you wish or
you can add the bass/bass.h and bass.lib files to your existing library folder by copying from the included libraries folder.

In the cmakelists.txt file set your LIBRARY_PATH variable to the correct path for you libraries.
set your startup file and build/run.


(note: the game should still compile without the added sound library BASS)
