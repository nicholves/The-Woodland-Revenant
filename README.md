Assignment 6

Nick
Added the ability to load terrain data from a basic custom heightfield map format using the resource manager and to render it using a basic terrain shader.

Heightfield (kelvin)
Created a Python script that produced the terrain.heightfield file present in the resources folder. The heightfield included simple craters/hills to give the sense and feel of the general shape of the moon's surface.

Kevin
Added a new function in camera.h/.cpp called UpdateYPos() that finds the player's surrounding vertices and corrects the y position of the camera.
